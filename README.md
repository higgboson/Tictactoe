Tic tac toe ,  an evergreen game with pretty simple rules , but this app is going to introduce new versions of tic tac toe with much harder rules to bring out  a better user engagement.This is build using Kotlin and Jetpack compose by using  Android studio as the IDE.

## Tech Stack Used
🧱 Built with Jetpack Compose & Kotlin
This project is developed using Jetpack Compose, Android's modern UI toolkit, and Kotlin, a concise and expressive programming language officially supported by Google for Android development.

**🧑‍🎨 Jetpack Compose**

Jetpack Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android.In this , the UI is described declaratively — meaning the app UI automatically updates when data changes, unlike XML layouts where eevery UI is imperative.

In this project, Compose helps:

🧩It can be use to make spash screens and many nested columns , rows and boxes.

🖼️ Manage custom themes, pixel fonts, and gradients

🔄Using navigation compose, we can do smoooth navigation between any screens.Various such dependencies can be imported into jetpack for a much more dynamic user interaction

**🛠 Kotlin**

Kotlin is the core programming language  used for this app. It has various features which are very useful

🧠 The feature of null safety is used which is effective in avoiding crashes and helps in avoiding null pointer exceptions.

✍️ Concise an a much clear syntax

💡 Functional (support for lambdas and collections)
